# Advanced Programming for Computer Design Problems

The course teaches you how to write *good* programs
with a specific focus on solving computer design problems.
You will gain hands-on experience in writing C++/Python code for 
implementing important data structures and algorithms,
such as graphs, dynamic programming, and machine learning
that are fundamental to this domain.
